net stop "Bluetooth Support Service"
timeout /t 3
net start "Bluetooth Support Service"

:: Disable Bluetooth Adapter
powershell -Command "Get-PnpDevice | Where-Object { $_.FriendlyName -like '*Bluetooth*' } | Disable-PnpDevice -Confirm:$false"
timeout /t 3

:: Enable Bluetooth Adapter
powershell -Command "Get-PnpDevice | Where-Object { $_.FriendlyName -like '*Bluetooth*' } | Enable-PnpDevice -Confirm:$false"

:: End
